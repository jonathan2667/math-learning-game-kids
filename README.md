# Math Learning Game for Kids ðŸ§®âœ¨

This simple yet engaging console-based game is designed to help children, like my sister, learn and practice basic arithmetic operations - addition and subtraction. The game dynamically generates math problems of varying difficulty, providing immediate feedback on the answers submitted by the player. It's a fun and interactive way to improve math skills!

## Features

- **Dynamic Problem Generation**: Creates random addition and subtraction problems to keep the learning experience fresh and challenging.
- **Immediate Feedback**: Offers instant feedback on each answer, letting players know if they've answered correctly or need to try again.
- **Score Tracking**: Keeps track of the number of correct and incorrect answers, encouraging improvement over time.
- **Color-Coded Responses**: Utilizes color coding to visually distinguish between correct (green) and incorrect (red) answers, making it easier for kids to follow along.
